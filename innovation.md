# Innovation is hard

More specifically, I am talking about incremental innovations.  
We often need a platform to continuously discover problems and solve the problem with innovative ideas.

Think about where, who, how you can discover problems, think from a user perspective.

You don’t have to follow this, but those two patterns might help you or give you some ideas

1. Discover problems by digging deeper, evil is in the detail, there will be an unlimited number of problems when look at it carefully enough.
2. Discover problems by going broader, don’t limit yourself by only looking at areas you already know, but generally look from a user perspective.

## The questions you can ask yourself

1. Do you have someone to brainstorm? They can be your family, friends, colleagues or anyone you can trust and share.
2. Is your mind ready to innovate? it takes courage to use your imagination to think about the unknown, you will get doubt from yourself and others when you start to experiment, that's why it's very important to find someone or group that can support you.
3. Do you have an environment to experiment with ideas?

Don't wait too long to start, don't wait too long to experiment, find someone that can support you.
